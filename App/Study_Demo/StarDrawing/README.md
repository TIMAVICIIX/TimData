# StarDrawing
A repository for storing open source project

/***********************StarðŸ–ŒDrawing*********************/

  This is an open Android projectðŸ˜ƒ. The main function of this application is to integrate painting and social integration, which can easily bring users to draw, quickly draw, and share typesetting.
  At present, the development progress is only about one tenth. It took me more than one week to make the basic Activity view and the art design on it, and it took me about two weeks to deploy them in my software.
  This is my first time to integrate and develop software. I am basically responsible for all the art design and code writing in it. In the near future, I also hope that someone can give me suggestions.But I prefer to finish the project by myself.
  

The following is the data flow diagram of the applicationï¼š
